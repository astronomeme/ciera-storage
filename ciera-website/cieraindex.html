			  <p class="newsheadline">Hello! I'm Naomi, a rising Junior and physics major at DePaul University in Chicago.
					I'm glad to be a part of Northwestern's CIERA REU program for the summer of 2021! While more about my research
					can be found in the pages linked above, I'd like to talk about my extracurriculars and other interests here
					(I always enjoy learning about my Professors as people from their research sites). So without further ado, let's go:
        </p>
        <p class="text" > ★ <b> Extracurriculars: </b>
					 At DePaul, I am SPS President for the 2021-2022 academic year (potentially
					 the next year as well). I'm also a member of the Astrophysics Society. Outside
					 of physics (as much as I love it), I'm a member of the tabletop roleplaying game
					 club, DeRPG, and have run a few Dungeons and Dragons oneshot games. When not caught
					 up in a pandemic, I volunteer at the Adler Planetarium, and have since 2016.
        </p>
        <p class="text" > ★ <b> Hobbies:</b>
					In my free time, I play the banjo! I also embroider and like to worldbuild for Tabletop RPGs.
					Podcasts are a big interest of mine, as are comic books and metal music. In my free time I also
					catch myself researching tons of random astrophysics questions! Wikipedia is always open on my laptop.
       </p>
